Java Basics to Exception Handling: A To-Do Manager Project
----------------------------------------------------------

About
-----
  This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and practical application of Java programming, covering everything from the fundamentals to advanced concepts of exception handling. 
  Designed for beginners and intermediate learners alike, this project walks you through the core principles of Java programming, applied in the development of a To-Do Manager application. Our journey begins with   the basics of Java and gradually progresses into the intricacies of object-oriented programming (OOP) and exception handling, ensuring a solid foundation for any aspiring Java developer.

Development Environment and Tools
---------------------------------
  This project was developed using the Eclipse IDE, a popular development environment for Java programming. Eclipse provides comprehensive support for Java development, including project management, code editing,   debugging, and testing functionalities. Here's a brief overview of the tools and environment used to develop and run this To-Do Manager project:

  Eclipse IDE
  -----------
    * Version: [Specify the version you used, e.g., Eclipse Photon, Eclipse 2020-06]
    * Project Setup: Java Project
    * Code Management: Utilized for writing, debugging, and testing the Java code. Eclipse's powerful features such as code completion, refactoring, and syntax highlighting were instrumental in the development        process.

  Java Development Kit (JDK)
  --------------------------
    Version: JDK 21
    Usage: The JDK is essential for developing and running Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), compiler (javac), and other utilities that facilitate Java application development.

  Git and GitHub
  --------------
    1. Version Control: Git was used for version control, enabling efficient tracking of changes and collaboration.
    2. GitHub: The codebase is hosted on GitHub, facilitating easy access, collaboration, and distribution. GitHub's integration with Eclipse through the EGit plugin streamlined the process of pushing code from   Eclipse to the GitHub repository.
  How to Set Up the Development Environment
  -----------------------------------------
    1. Install Eclipse IDE:
      Download and install Eclipse from the official website. Choose the version compatible with your JDK.
    2. Install JDK:
      Ensure that you have the JDK installed on your system. Download it from Oracle's official site or adopt OpenJDK.
    3. Clone the Project:
      Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.
    4. Import the Project in Eclipse:
      Open Eclipse and select `File` > `Import` > `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace`. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project and import it.
    5. Configure JDK:
      Ensure the project is using the correct JDK version by right-clicking on the project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries and setting the JDK version.

What You Will Learn
-------------------
  1. Java Basics: Understanding the syntax, variables, data types, and control statements to control the flow of the application.
  2. OOP Concepts: Diving deep into object-oriented principles, including:
  3. Objects and Classes: The building blocks of OOP, enabling the creation of modular and reusable code.
  4. Inheritance: Leveraging code reuse and establishing a hierarchical classification.
  5. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementations behind simplified interfaces.
  6. Polymorphism: Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
  7. Encapsulation: Protecting the internal state of objects and only exposing what is necessary.
  8. Constructors and Keywords (this, final, super, static): Understanding their roles in class instantiation, inheritance, and static context.
  9. Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Defining contracts for subclasses and supporting multiple inheritance.
  10. Overloading and Overriding: Customizing class methods to suit the needs of your application.
  11. Exception Handling: Learning to anticipate and manage runtime errors for a robust application.

Project Overview: To-Do Manager
-------------------------------
The To-Do Manager project is a practical application of the Java concepts covered in this repository. It illustrates how to:

  1. Model a To-Do Item: Using classes to represent tasks with properties such as title, description, due date, and status.
  2. Manage Tasks: Employing collections to handle and store multiple to-do items efficiently.
  3. Utilize Control Statements: For task operations like adding, removing, and updating tasks.
  4. Apply OOP Principles: To organize the codebase for clarity, reusability, and scalability. Each aspect of the project, from task management to UI, demonstrates a specific OOP concept in action.
  5. Handle Exceptions: Ensuring the application gracefully handles unexpected situations, like input mismatches or file access issues.

Contribution
------------
  1. Navigate to the Project Directory: cd myrepodetails
  2. Fork the Repository: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This creates your own copy of the project, where you can make changes without affecting the original codebase.
  3. Clone Your Fork: Clone your forked repository to your local machine to start working on the changes.
     Use the Git command: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repodetails.git
  4. Create a New Branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch in your cloned repository. This helps isolate your changes and makes the merging process smoother.
     Use the Git command: git checkout -b new-branch-name
  5. Make Your Changes: Implement your proposed changes, enhancements, or fixes in your branch. Be sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
  6. Commit Your Changes: After making your changes, commit them to your branch. Provide a clear and descriptive commit message, explaining what you've done and why.
     Use the Git command: git commit -m "Add a concise and informative commit message"
  7. Push Changes to Your Fork: To push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
     Use the Git command: git push origin new-branch-name
  8. Submit a Pull Request: Go to the original repository on GitHub, and you'll see an option to submit a pull request from your branch. Click on it, provide a detailed description of your changes, and submit the      pull request.

Stay Updated
------------
Make sure to keep your fork synchronized with the main repository by regularly pulling in changes. This helps avoid merge conflicts and ensures your contributions are based on the latest version of the project.
